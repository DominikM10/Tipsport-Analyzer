# NHL Fantasy Lineup Optimizer — Tipsport Analyzer
This project is a data-driven analyzer that optimizes NHL fantasy lineups for Tipsport's daily fantasy game. Its core function is to identify high-value, under-priced players to generate "alpha" (excess returns) against the market's cash prices.

It moves beyond simple point averages by incorporating a statistically grounded approach, including dynamic performance weighting and special adjustments for high-potential rookies, to build a competitive and reproducible fantasy lineup.

A sample lineup report generated by the optimizer.

🔑 Key Features
- Data-Driven Optimization: Automatically builds an optimal lineup based on player cost, projected points, and positional constraints.

- Dynamic Performance Weighting: Implements a sigmoid function to give more weight to recent games, ensuring player projections are based on current form, not just season-long averages.

- Rookie Amplification: Applies a statistical adjustment to promising rookies, identifying high-upside players before their price fully reflects their potential.

- Extensible Architecture: Designed with multiple modes (Greedy, Iterative, and ML-based) to allow for different levels of computational depth and analysis.
